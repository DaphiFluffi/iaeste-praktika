    "description": "Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant was established in 2008 and currently has more than 165 employees.\n We work in a unique, open innovation pilot and demonstration facility for process development, scaling up and (trial) production of bio-based products and processes, from laboratory to multi-ton scale.\n \n We combine a wide and flexible range of modular unit operations with a team of highly qualified and experienced bio-process engineers and technicians to translate laboratory-scale bio-based processes into cost-effective industrial processes. Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant wants to be the workplace where all employees can grow and use their full potential. We offer a pleasant atmosphere, value and reward initiative, hard work and commitment.\n \n ********\n \n TOPIC 4 - Hybrid process development for upcycling mixed plastic waste into high-value dicarboxylic acids\n Available from July 2025\n \n Project description:\n The HYBRID project aims to address two major challenges: the incineration of difficult-to-recycle plastic waste, leading to CO2 emissions, and the fossil-based production of virgin plastics from long-chain dicarboxylic acid (DCA) monomers. By integrating pyrolysis, biological funnelling, fermentation, and advanced product recovery techniques, the project seeks to convert mixed plastic waste into high-value DCAs, critical for producing textile polymers, polyesters, lubricants, and plasticizers.\n This internship, part of the HYBRID project, focuses on upcycling plastic waste into DCAs using a yeast-based fermentation platform. Key tasks include:\n Fermentation Process Development: Investigate and optimize the fermentation behaviour of engineered strains with varying waste-derived feedstocks.\n Biphasic Fermentation: Develop an advanced, multi-phase fermentation process with in situ product recovery and resource recycling.\n Process Integration and Scale-Up: Transfer and evaluate the developed process at bioreactor scale and boost the process performance by in-depth optimisation. Collaborate with engineers to scale up the optimized process.\n This internship at Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant (BBEPP) offers hands-on experience in fermentation and downstream purification technologies and supports the transition to a circular bio economy. All experimental work will be performed in the industrial environment of BBEPP using state-of-the-art equipment, in cooperation with a team of experienced professionals. Your work will contribute to the Flemish-funded HYBRID project, crucial for further development and industrial scale-up.",

    "description": "The Research Group in Innovation and Development of Specialty Coffee, aims to conduct research across two lines: the transformation of specialty coffees and the governance and sustainability of the coffee ecosystem. We are seeking students in Chemical Engineering, Food Engineering, Biotechnology, Agricultural Engineering, and Agro-Industrial Engineering, who are interested in understanding how post-harvest processes affect coffee quality. Specialty Coffee refers to coffee that is graded 80 points or higher, on a 100 point scale, which has been certified by a licensed Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) Q Grader (CQI). At the RoastLab, Univalle https://sigelab.net/laboratorio/ElKStj7fl51OmQ6bvi5o , physical and chemical tests are conducted on Arabica coffee beans grown in the Colombian Coffee Cultural Landscape area. The purpose is to identify the potential for specialty coffee that can be valued by coffee consumers worldwide. These results are then transferred to producers to help standardize the processes that enable them to obtain better coffee and become more competitive in global markets.\n The student will develop the following tasks: Physical characterization of green (fresh), dried, and roasted coffee beans. Chemical characterization of green, dried, and roasted coffee beans. Experimentation in the lab and on the farm (in the field, at the productive unit, to obtain a specialty coffee). Participation in the results transfer processes with producers and the academic community. Support in the analysis of relocation agendas and the production agenda for the region (Valle del Cauca) with sustainable development criteria. ​​Participation in academic meetings, seminars, and research debates.",

The ML segment focused on predictive modeling using supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning with algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.

Traditionally, LULC classification relies on manual interpretation or conventional statistical techniques, which are often time-consuming and less accurate in handling large-scale remote sensing datasets.\n Machine Learning (ML) provides efficient and automated approaches to analyze satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) for precise classification of land categories such as agriculture, water bodies, forests, and built-up areas. This project aims to apply ML techniques to classify LULC from remote sensing imagery, evaluate their accuracy, and recommend the best-performing models.\" \"Preprocessed satellite dataset for ROI.\n \n Trained ML models for LULC classification.\n LULC thematic maps showing classified categories.\n Accuracy analysis report comparing multiple ML models.\n Workflow documentation for scalable LULC monitoring projects.\n \n This project proposes the use of machine learning for efficient LULC classification, enabling accurate and scalable mapping of land categories from satellite data. The workflow developed can support applications in agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. The project is achievable within a 6–8 week internship and will provide hands-on exposure to both remote sensing and machine learning techniques.",

    "description": "The Machine Learning-Driven Design of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) for CO2 capture relies heavily on computational screening to find sustainable, high-performance solvents. COSMO-RS (Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) are the core predictive tools. DFT models are used to analyze the molecular structure and electronic properties of DES components. This data is then fed into COSMO-RS to accurately forecast thermodynamic properties crucial for CO2 capture. This integrated approach enables the research to refine solvent choices and ensure their thermodynamic and kinetic suitability for high-efficiency, low-energy CO2 removal, thereby avoiding the costly experimental synthesis and large-scale testing required for traditional methods.",
