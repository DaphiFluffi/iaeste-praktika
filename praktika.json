We are seeking students in Chemical Engineering, Food Engineering, Biotechnology, Agricultural Engineering, and Agro-Industrial Engineering, who are interested in understanding how post-harvest processes affect coffee quality. Specialty Coffee refers to coffee that is graded 80 points or higher, on a 100 point scale, which has been certified by a licensed Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) Q Grader (CQI). At the RoastLab, Univalle https://sigelab.net/laboratorio/ElKStj7fl51OmQ6bvi5o , physical and chemical tests are conducted on Arabica coffee beans grown in the Colombian Coffee Cultural Landscape area. The purpose is to identify the potential for specialty coffee that can be valued by coffee consumers worldwide. These results are then transferred to producers to help standardize the processes that enable them to obtain better coffee and become more competitive in global markets.\n The student will develop the following tasks: Physical characterization of green (fresh), dried, and roasted coffee beans. Chemical characterization of green, dried, and roasted coffee beans. Experimentation in the lab and on the farm (in the field, at the productive unit, to obtain a specialty coffee). Participation in the results transfer processes with producers and the academic community. Support in the analysis of relocation agendas and the production agenda for the region (Valle del Cauca) with sustainable development criteria. ​​Participation in academic meetings, seminars, and research debates.",

Traditionally, LULC classification relies on manual interpretation or conventional statistical techniques, which are often time-consuming and less accurate in handling large-scale remote sensing datasets.\n Machine Learning (ML) provides efficient and automated approaches to analyze satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) for precise classification of land categories such as agriculture, water bodies, forests, and built-up areas. This project aims to apply ML techniques to classify LULC from remote sensing imagery, evaluate their accuracy, and recommend the best-performing models.\" \"Preprocessed satellite dataset for ROI.\n \n Trained ML models for LULC classification.\n LULC thematic maps showing classified categories.\n Accuracy analysis report comparing multiple ML models.\n Workflow documentation for scalable LULC monitoring projects.\n \n This project proposes the use of machine learning for efficient LULC classification, enabling accurate and scalable mapping of land categories from satellite data. The workflow developed can support applications in agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. The project is achievable within a 6–8 week internship and will provide hands-on exposure to both remote sensing and machine learning techniques.",

It is very important to apply as soon as you get you acceptance papers from IAESTE THAILAND the application procedure sometimes takes 8-12 weeks. The type of visa that you must get is Non-immigrant-“ED” only. If you wish to travel to the countries nearby Thailand, make sure that you have the multi-entries visa. We need to be informed about your visa extension at least 2 weeks before its expiration date.\n \n Remarks :\n **-In the past, bringing a significant other person while attending the internship has proven to be unsuccessful. Conflicts in schedules and distractions have in some cases led to a less than productive experience for both the intern and the employer. It is therefore requested that a trainee arrive unaccompanied to get maximum benefit from the time spent in his/her internship.",
