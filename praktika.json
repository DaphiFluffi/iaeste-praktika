    "description": "Industry 5.0 is the emerging trend of manufacturing technologies towards smart factories. The industrial internet of things (IIoT) plays a primordial role to achieve the objectives of Industry 5.0, by enabling the cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) to communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans both internally and across the participants of the supply chain. \nIn an IIoT environment, a huge amount of data is continuously generated by sensors. The generated data should be then analyzed by the controller to generate valuable information for factory operations and driving the access and control of CPPS devices through actuators. The data in IIoT are usually critical in both mission and time, for which even a minor undesired delay may result in catastrophic situation. In addition to the latency constraint of IIoT applications, the Industry 5.0 should face the limitation of network\ndevices in terms of energy, especially in harsh or hazardous industrial scenarios, such as the production industry and mining, where it may not be possible to connect devices to a power source or the power supply is self-powered. Consequently, it is crucial to develop an adequate data management scheme, considering the strict requirements of industrial applications.\nThe traditional centralized data management in IIoT is inappropriate for real applications because of its communication overhead and inability to cope with strict delay requirements of IIoT applications and energy constraints of IIoT networks. Therefore, recent researches focus on developing a distributed data management layer for IIoT. \nHowever, such a distributed data management layer is susceptible to attacks targeting the confidentiality and integrity of data cached on distributed nodes. In this context, the objective of this training is to propose a blockchain-based distributed data management layer for IIoT that guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of data cached in the distributed management layer.",

Students progress through quests, earn achievements, compete on leaderboards, and collaborate in guilds - all while mastering programming concepts. The platform has achieved remarkable results: zero dropout rates among active users, and students who participate consistently perform significantly better on exams than those who don't.\nOver 1,000 students have used Universet, with peaks of 300 concurrent users during active periods. All code and logs are stored on the University of Oslo's infrastructure, giving us access to high-end load balancing and robust scaling possibilities as we continue to grow.\nOur work has been recognized with multiple prestigious awards in 2024 and 2025, including the University of Oslo's Teaching Prize 2024. What started as an innovative approach to teaching introductory computer science is now being prepared for rollout across multiple disciplines, potentially transforming how thousands of students learn.\nThis spring, we're in full-scale development with over 10 dedicated developers building the next generation of the platform. Many of our current developers were themselves students who used Universet and loved it so much they wanted to contribute to its evolution. We're now looking for talented international students to join us this summer and be part of this exciting expansion.

For both polymer composites, the material preparation is followed by testing (tensile test,\ncompression test, harness test, DSC, TGA, .. etc). The results are to be evaluated/analyzed in weekly basis to decide the next step for the material\ndevelopment. By the end of the training, the student is expected to gain a good knowledge in polymers processing and testing.",

All interns begin with the core web fundamentals: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and introductory Node.js. Early tasks include creating responsive layouts, translating design mockups into functional interfaces, implementing reusable UI components, and writing simple client-side scripts to handle user interactions.\n\nInterns pursuing front-end development will then advance to React.js and Next.js. Their work will involve designing functional components, managing state with hooks, integrating external APIs, optimizing rendering performance, and contributing to small interactive applications that reflect real industry workflows.\n\nInterns selecting a back-end path will specialize in one of three focus areas. Those working with C# and ASP.NET Core will implement REST APIs, handle routing, work with Entity Framework, and manage authentication logic. Those choosing Python will focus on server-side logic, data handling, and basic automation tasks. Interns selecting PHP with Laravel will work on MVC architecture, routing, controllers, Blade templates, and database migrations.\n\nThe objectives of the internship are to give each intern hands-on experience with modern development practices, strengthen their understanding of full-stack workflows, and improve their ability to work within a professional development environment. The program aims to enhance technical and problem-solving skills, introduce interns to version control and collaborative coding, and prepare them for real software development roles by assigning tasks that contribute to ongoing GridsApps projects.",

Interns will actively participate in routine microbiological analyses, including culturing, staining, and identification of microorganisms, while assisting faculty and researchers in projects related to medical microbiology, infectious diseases, and public health. They will conduct experiments under supervision, ensuring strict adherence to biosafety and aseptic techniques, and contribute to sample collection, preparation, and data recording for clinical and environmental studies. Additional responsibilities include maintaining laboratory equipment, preparing reagents, and ensuring proper waste disposal in compliance with institutional safety standards. Interns will also support literature reviews, data entry, and preliminary analysis for research publications, while collaborating with peers and supervisors to present findings in seminars, workshops, or departmental meetings. The internship emphasizes professional growth through hands-on technical training, analytical problem-solving, and effective communication, preparing interns to understand the role of microbiology in diagnostics, infection control, and public health policy. Supervision will be provided by faculty and laboratory staff, with performance evaluated on technical competence, adherence to safety protocols, teamwork, and contribution to research activities. Interns are expected to commit to regular laboratory hours over the course of one academic semester, demonstrate reliability, initiative, and uphold the values of integrity, responsibility, and dedication to advancing knowledge.
