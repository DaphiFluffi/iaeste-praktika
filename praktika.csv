 Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping plays a vital role in urban planning, agriculture monitoring, deforestation studies, and climate change research. Traditionally, LULC classification relies on manual interpretation or conventional statistical techniques, which are often time-consuming and less accurate in handling large-scale remote sensing datasets.
 Machine Learning (ML) provides efficient and automated approaches to analyze satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) for precise classification of land categories such as agriculture, water bodies, forests, and built-up areas. This project aims to apply ML techniques to classify LULC from remote sensing imagery, evaluate their accuracy, and recommend the best-performing models."" ""Preprocessed satellite dataset for ROI.

 Project Title: Development of Polymeric and Metallic Composite-Based Electrodeposited Coating and Its Characterization
 
 Project Overview:
 This project focuses on developing polymer-reinforced metallic coatings using electrodeposition and electrophoretic deposition techniques to prevent corrosion, which occurs when metals react with oxygen and water, forming oxides that degrade structural integrity. Such degradation can lead to structural failure and economic losses. The coatings will be designed for applications in aeronautical, automotive, marine, electrical, and mechanical industries, providing durable and protective surfaces. The project will evaluate coating performance using methods like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization, hardness testing, tribology analysis, adhesion studies, and surface imaging. By combining metallic and polymeric components, the study aims to enhance corrosion resistance, mechanical strength, and surface durability, contributing to the development of long-lasting and cost-effective protective coatings for industrial applications.
 
 Expected Outcome:
 • Fabrication of polymer-metal composite coatings through electrodeposition and EPD.
 • Performance evaluation using electrochemical and mechanical tests.
 • Analytical report detailing coating characteristics and effectiveness.
 • Presentation summarizing results, surface analyses, and industrial applicability.",10,10,07.05.2026,28.09.2026,English,"Excellent (C1, C2)",,,,,,,INR,16000,Monthly,0%,IAESTE,8500,16000,Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,,1,"Handling Electrochemical Instrument, Polymer Synthesis, Good experimental hand, Teamwork.",Chemistry and Chemical Engineering
