 TOPIC 4 - Hybrid process development for upcycling mixed plastic waste into high-value dicarboxylic acids
 Available from July 2025
 
 Project description:
 The HYBRID project aims to address two major challenges: the incineration of difficult-to-recycle plastic waste, leading to CO2 emissions, and the fossil-based production of virgin plastics from long-chain dicarboxylic acid (DCA) monomers. By integrating pyrolysis, biological funnelling, fermentation, and advanced product recovery techniques, the project seeks to convert mixed plastic waste into high-value DCAs, critical for producing textile polymers, polyesters, lubricants, and plasticizers.
 This internship, part of the HYBRID project, focuses on upcycling plastic waste into DCAs using a yeast-based fermentation platform. Key tasks include:
 Fermentation Process Development: Investigate and optimize the fermentation behaviour of engineered strains with varying waste-derived feedstocks.
 Biphasic Fermentation: Develop an advanced, multi-phase fermentation process with in situ product recovery and resource recycling.
 Process Integration and Scale-Up: Transfer and evaluate the developed process at bioreactor scale and boost the process performance by in-depth optimisation. Collaborate with engineers to scale up the optimized process.
 This internship at Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant (BBEPP) offers hands-on experience in fermentation and downstream purification technologies and supports the transition to a circular bio economy. All experimental work will be performed in the industrial environment of BBEPP using state-of-the-art equipment, in cooperation with a team of experienced professionals.

 Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping plays a vital role in urban planning, agriculture monitoring, deforestation studies, and climate change research. Traditionally, LULC classification relies on manual interpretation or conventional statistical techniques, which are often time-consuming and less accurate in handling large-scale remote sensing datasets.
 Machine Learning (ML) provides efficient and automated approaches to analyze satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) for precise classification of land categories such as agriculture, water bodies, forests, and built-up areas.

 Project Title: Development of Polymeric and Metallic Composite-Based Electrodeposited Coating and Its Characterization
 
 Project Overview:
 This project focuses on developing polymer-reinforced metallic coatings using electrodeposition and electrophoretic deposition techniques to prevent corrosion, which occurs when metals react with oxygen and water, forming oxides that degrade structural integrity. Such degradation can lead to structural failure and economic losses. The coatings will be designed for applications in aeronautical, automotive, marine, electrical, and mechanical industries, providing durable and protective surfaces. The project will evaluate coating performance using methods like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization, hardness testing, tribology analysis, adhesion studies, and surface imaging. By combining metallic and polymeric components, the study aims to enhance corrosion resistance, mechanical strength, and surface durability, contributing to the development of long-lasting and cost-effective protective coatings for industrial applications.
 
 Expected Outcome:
 • Fabrication of polymer-metal composite coatings through electrodeposition and EPD.
 • Performance evaluation using electrochemical and mechanical tests.
 • Analytical report detailing coating characteristics and effectiveness.
 • Presentation summarizing results, surface analyses, and industrial applicability.";10;10;07.05.2026;28.09.2026;English;Excellent (C1, C2);;;;;;;INR;16000;Monthly;0%;IAESTE;8500;16000;Chemistry and Chemical Engineering;;1;Handling Electrochemical Instrument, Polymer Synthesis, Good experimental hand, Teamwork.;Chemistry and Chemical EngineeringJO-2026-101-AJI;ON-SITE;15.03.2026;AJI Group;Amman, Jordan;Jordan;https://ajigroup.com/intl-en;Al-Rawabi, Amman, Jordan;Engineering Firm;215;45;9;;The applicant must submit a portfolio along with their application.;"Company Description:
