The industrial internet of things (IIoT) plays a primordial role to achieve the objectives of Industry 5.0, by enabling the cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) to communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans both internally and across the participants of the supply chain. 
In an IIoT environment, a huge amount of data is continuously generated by sensors. The generated data should be then analyzed by the controller to generate valuable information for factory operations and driving the access and control of CPPS devices through actuators. The data in IIoT are usually critical in both mission and time, for which even a minor undesired delay may result in catastrophic situation. In addition to the latency constraint of IIoT applications, the Industry 5.0 should face the limitation of network
devices in terms of energy, especially in harsh or hazardous industrial scenarios, such as the production industry and mining, where it may not be possible to connect devices to a power source or the power supply is self-powered. Consequently, it is crucial to develop an adequate data management scheme, considering the strict requirements of industrial applications.
The traditional centralized data management in IIoT is inappropriate for real applications because of its communication overhead and inability to cope with strict delay requirements of IIoT applications and energy constraints of IIoT networks. Therefore, recent researches focus on developing a distributed data management layer for IIoT. 
However, such a distributed data management layer is susceptible to attacks targeting the confidentiality and integrity of data cached on distributed nodes. In this context, the objective of this training is to propose a blockchain-based distributed data management layer for IIoT that guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of data cached in the distributed management layer.",7,10,1/7/2026,30/9/2026,English,"Good (B1, B2)",,,,,,,IRR,0,Monthly,IAESTE IRAN,0,Monthly,0,Monthly,

Universet is a gamified learning platform that transforms computer science education into an engaging adventure. Students progress through quests, earn achievements, compete on leaderboards, and collaborate in guilds - all while mastering programming concepts. The platform has achieved remarkable results: zero dropout rates among active users, and students who participate consistently perform significantly better on exams than those who don't.
Over 1,000 students have used Universet, with peaks of 300 concurrent users during active periods. All code and logs are stored on the University of Oslo's infrastructure, giving us access to high-end load balancing and robust scaling possibilities as we continue to grow.
Our work has been recognized with multiple prestigious awards in 2024 and 2025, including the University of Oslo's Teaching Prize 2024. What started as an innovative approach to teaching introductory computer science is now being prepared for rollout across multiple disciplines, potentially transforming how thousands of students learn.
This spring, we're in full-scale development with over 10 dedicated developers building the next generation of the platform. Many of our current developers were themselves students who used Universet and loved it so much they wanted to contribute to its evolution. We're now looking for talented international students to join us this summer and be part of this exciting expansion.
